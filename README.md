# AI-Powered Healthcare & Medicine Quality Website

Public health outcomes depend heavily on three critical factors - keeping medications safe, getting disease diagnoses right and tailoring treatment recommendations to what each patient actually needs. The way we've traditionally done clinical evaluations has some real problems though. It relies so much on manual interpretation, which honestly just takes forever, leads to mistakes and gives you different results depending on who's doing the evaluation. That's where things get interesting - over the past few years, artificial intelligence, machine learning and data-driven diagnostic systems have gotten good enough that they're becoming genuine alternatives for automated healthcare decision support. So in this study, what we built is an integrated AI-Powered Healthcare Portal that handles three key medical tasks all in one place. First, Medicine Quality Prediction checks whether tablets are safe by looking at environmental factors and lab parameters. Second, Disease Prediction from Symptoms - this uses high-dimensional symptom vectors with a Random Forest model to figure out what's most likely causing someone's symptoms. Third, Medicine Recommendation uses optimized models like XGBoost and Random Forest to suggest treatments across three completely different medical systems - homeopathy, allopathy and Ayurveda. We tested this thing extensively and honestly the results were better than expected - medicine quality evaluation hit 98.64% accuracy, disease prediction reached 100% and medicine recommendation systems averaged 71.36% accuracy across the board. What all this really demonstrates is that the system can help doctors make better clinical judgments, dramatically reduce how long patients sit around waiting for diagnoses and deliver care that's both more reliable and actually centered on what individual patients need.
